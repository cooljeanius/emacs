Inspired by my similar list for apple-gdb, this file contains a list
of past versions of apple-emacs which were the last versions to contain
certain files. I have tried to copy files from these older versions
into this distribution when relevant. Feel free to add to this list
if you are able to narrow down the last appearances of other files.
(This would be so much easier if Apple would just open up their VCS
to us... or maybe it is open but just hidden? idk...)

	- 39: first version available

	- 41: last version with GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE, and various files
	in `etc/`, emacs.csh and qsort.c in `lib-src/`, a number of lisp
	files in `lisp/`, and a bunch of sources (mostly vms-related)
	in `src/`.
	Also `install.sh` had not yet been renamed to `install-sh` here.

	- 51: last version that shipped a bunch of generated junk files
	in `man/`, and a few files in `nt/`.

	- 56: last version with a toplevel dpkg directory

	- 59: last version where dumpemacs is a shell script

	- 60: last version with `src/unexdyld.c`, the entire `info/`
	subdirectory, a handwritten aclocal.m4, a few files in `lib-src/`,
	any compiled lisp bytecode files (the ones ending in `.elc`),
	any image files in `lisp/gnus/` (or its parent directory, for that
	matter), the `mh-*.el` batch of files being kept in `lisp/mail/`
	instead of their own subdir, the entire `lisp/toolbar/` subdir,
	a few files in `lwlib/`, CodeWarrior5-specific sources in `mac/`,
	and various other sources in `src/` that might be of interest
	in this Apple-specific branch, such as `src/m/powermacintosh.h`
	and `src/s/rhapsody.h`.

	- 70.1: last version with the emacswrapper.c and isemacsvalid.c
	files, and a separate `unexmacosx.c.diff` patchfile

	- 92: most recent version available as of October 2014
