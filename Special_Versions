Inspired by my similar list for apple-gdb, this file contains a list
of past versions of apple-emacs which were the last versions to contain
certain files. I have tried to copy files from these older versions
into this distribution when relevant. Feel free to add to this list
if you are able to narrow down the last appearances of other files.
(This would be so much easier if Apple would just open up their VCS
to us... or maybe it is open but just hidden? idk...)

	- 39: first version available

	- 56: last version with a toplevel dpkg directory

	- 59: last version where dumpemacs is a shell script

	- 70.1: last version with emacswrapper.c and isemacsvalid.c

	- 92: most recent version available as of October 2014

# Versioning scheme and stuff comes from:

and
