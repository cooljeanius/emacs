Emacs generally follows the GNU coding standards when it comes to ChangeLogs:
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html

One exception is that we still sometimes quote `like-this' (as the
standards used to recommend) rather than 'like-this' (as they do now),
because `...' is so widely used elsewhere in Emacs.

If installing changes written by someone else, make the ChangeLog
entry in their name, not yours.

  There is no need to make change log entries for files such as NEWS,
  MAINTAINERS, and FOR-RELEASE.
"There is no need" means you don't have to, but you can if you want to.

  There is no need to indicate regeneration of files such as configure
  in ChangeLog.

Preferred form for several entries with the same content:

   * help.el (view-lossage):
   * kmacro.el (kmacro-edit-lossage):
   * edmacro.el (edit-kbd-macro): Fix docstring, lossage is now 300 keys.

(Rather than anything involving "ditto" and suchlike.)
