(This is a draft.  The method here won't actually work yet, because
neither git-new-workdir nor merge-changelog are in the Emacs
distribution yet.)

Setting up and using git for normal, simple bugfixing
=====================================================

If you haven't configured git before you should first do:

git config --global user.name "Frank Chu"
git config --global user.email "fchu@example.com"
git config --global transfer.fsckObjects true

(See the thread "Recommend these .gitconfig settings for git integrity."
[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-01/threads.html#01802]
for more details about why that last line is there.)

Initial setup
=============

Then we want to clone the repository.  We normally want to have both
the current trunk and the emacs-24 branch.

mkdir ~/emacs
cd ~/emacs
git clone <membername>@git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/emacs.git
mv emacs trunk
(cd trunk; git config push.default current)
./trunk/admin/git-new-workdir trunk emacs-24
cd emacs-24
git checkout emacs-24
git config push.default current

You now have both branches conveniently accessible, and you can do
"git pull" in them once in a while to keep updated.


Fixing bugs
===========

You edit the files in either branch, `M-x vc-dir', and check in your
changes.  Then you need to push the data to the main repository.  This
will usually fail, since somebody else has pushed other changes in the
meantime.  To fix this, say

git pull --rebase

which will update your repository, and then re-apply your changes on
top of that.  Then say

git push


Backporting to emacs-24
=======================

If you have applied a fix to the trunk, but then decide that it should
be applied to the emacs-24 branch, too, then

cd ~/emacs/trunk
git log

and find the commit you're looking for.  Then find the commit ID,
which will look like

commit 958b768a6534ae6e77a8547a56fc31b46b63710b

cd ~/emacs/emacs-24
git cherry-pick -xe 958b768a6534ae6e77a8547a56fc31b46b63710b

and add "Backport:" to the commit string.  Then

git push


Merging emacs-24 to trunk
=========================

This has yet to be written.


Warnings about X11 forwarding
=============================

If you get warnings like

Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0

when pulling or pushing data, add the following to the start of
~/.ssh/config:

Host git.sv.gnu.org
   ForwardX11 no
